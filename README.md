# Mage Mirror will meld your muffins

## Installation

First, your python snake will install itself:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you have to be a strong child because NPM is going to hurt you:
```
npm install
```

## Running the python snake

To make your python snake run, first cordially invite sad-words code to be packed into a small box:
```
webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

The snake will emerge from its dwelling place upon utterance of the correct incantation. Let these words of wisdom fill your parietal lobe; let their abstract representation echo through your neocortex until you ~~truly understand~~ the nature of the snake man:
```
export FLASK_APP=server.py && flask run
```
